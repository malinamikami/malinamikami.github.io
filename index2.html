			<p>The lemon squeezer project was created for SJSU's DSGD100 class. The idea behind this project was to select an object and work with it throughout the semester. By doing so, we as designers would be able to learn different ways to illustrate the object in different 2d mannerism. Our first assignment was to draw the object in a life like form in our own selected position. </p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>For this colorized open lemon squeezer, we were tasked to use only three different colors of CMYK to design the form of the object. By simplifying the construction of the lemon squeezer to its main distinguishing parts, I was able to minimalize the squeezer and integrate it with the negative background in order to create a readable design, without being too obvious.</p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>The "Make It Rain" squeezer illustration ties with the association of lemon squeezers and the point of their usage, to produce juice. The color palatte chosen for this was to dissimilate the expected vibrant yellow that is associated with lemons and lemon squeezers. By using a darker color palette of black and grey, we dissociate the happy integrity of the lemon squeezer and its production of lemonade.</p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>The "Pressed" and "Lemon" illustrations were designed as logos. For the "Pressed" logo I focused on the use of space to create sections/units of space. I wanted to keep the illustrations of the lemon squeezers to be straight forward and concise, but alternating them on top of one another it creates seperate directioinality. By including the word 'pressed' I was able to create four seperate boxes of negative space which creates grid like symmetry. As for the "Lemon" logo, I focused the design solely on the squeezing end of the squeezer, the part that pushes into the lemon. I thought that this essential part of the object is easily distinguishable without having to include the handles of the object. By spacing the word 'lemon' out, the illustration and typeface reads as a unit.</p>

			<p>How Much? This poster was the final design for the SJSU DSGD100 class. Personally one of the more challenging designs of the semester. We were assigned to integrate the image of our selected object and merge text that would inform and audience. I wanted to use bold/striking colors that would narate the topic of this poster. By including the organic shapes of the lemons into the background as well as the structized banner in the front, I believe I was able to succesfully display the content and or topic of the poster without having to literally write out the word 'lemon'.</p>

			<p>These next designs were created for the SJSU DSGN111 class. The topic of this assignment was to create a booklet that would illustrate what our own perception of "good design" is. I wanted to take an ambiguous approach towards this assignment by not using text to describe design, but by rather using images and design itself. The focus of my approach was to create illustrations that I, personally, percieved as images that provoked a feeling, thought, and/or understanding. On my title page of the booklet, I included an exerpt of my own perception of 'good design'.</p>

		<center><img id="ten-div" src="img/rainbow.jpg"></center>
		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>This rainbow strip design was created for my senior graduating design class. The project was focused on designing an ambigious storyline on the background of a classmate. We were given a list of questions to which we then proceeded to interview an individual in our class. The concept of my design illustrates the growth and movement into different colors, which represents the individuals growth into defining the appreciations in their own life. The center image of the design, the red/coral color, is a focal point into my interviewees understanding of self. Thoughout the illustration are words that are integrated within the organic shapes. Important words that reflect the interviewees sense of being, words like; feel, bloom, express, growth, and exist. I resonated these words from the muse of my design. </p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>The distorted Earth poster was created with the term Anthropocene in mind. Similarly to my DSGN100 class, we were given the choice of a few topics to chose from that would then become the definite article of our design for the class. In this case, I chose the term Anthropocene. This term has been coined as the era in which our society is currently living in, an era where human activity has been the leading force and influence on the Earths climate and enviornment. Thus because this involves the planet in which we live on, I distorted the shape of the Earth and overlayed a finger print vector design to represent humanity and its impression on planet Earth.</p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>The circle of figures design was another design that I had created for my senior design class. For this design we each had to build a "calling intention", basically a mission statement true to ourselves. With this inention in mind, we were assigned to project our perception of it, into a 2d form. The unisex figures are illustrated together in a circle, and within them is a light that bubbles outwards. This light is representative of growth and awareness, and the figures that surround it, have come together to unify and exand themselves.</p>

		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>This fish illustration was designed for SJSU's DSGN111 class. Our goal was to illustrate the 'truth in design'. In the design field, creating iteration after iteration, print after print, its inevitable that waste will be produced. My own perception on the truth in design is that regardless of the effort put into creating as little waste as possible, waste is still being made, thus impacting our enviornment by this never ending cycle of things being made and produced. The fish is symbolic towards all creatures, in specific sea creatures, that are effected by the waste being made by design and the recognition of this impact.</p>

			<p>The bunny hop. This illustration was created by using a audio mixer tool downloaded from the web. I chose this particular image because of its cuteness factor as well as it being somewhat boring in terms of color. By throwing it into the audio mixer app I was able to create static and echo into the image, redesigning it with a difference in saturation, texture, and inversion of color. By doing so, this completely recreates the look of the image, changing it completely from what it was before.</p>

		<center><img id="fifteen-div" src="img/meme.jpg"></center>
		<div class="flexbox-container">
			<p>This meme was designed for my ART72 class at SJSU. Discussing the top of pop culture and its importance on mondern day individuals, meme's came up as an important factor in our day to day lives. The assignment was to create a simple mean that would be understood by the class. The meme I had created was inspired by an image that I came across during my travels to Japan during the summer of 2019. I came across this toast image while walking past a bakery and thought how fun and unique it looked in comparision to the other store fronts and their illustrations. This meme is also inspired by the 'lax' lifestyle here in California. Avocodos are apart of this stereotypical lifestyle. By combing the theme and text relating to avacodos with the imagery from the bakery shop in Japan, I created this awkward meme.</p>
